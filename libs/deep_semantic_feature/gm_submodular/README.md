### What is this repository for? ###
This repo contains a python package with tools for submodular maximization and learning mixtures of submodular functions (SSVM).

1. Inference: Lazy greedy maximization [Minoux. Optimization Techniques 1978], Cost-sensitive maximization [Leskovec et al. ACM SIGKDD 2007]
2. Learning: Mixture learning with SGD [Lin & Bilmes. UAI 2012] and AdaGrad [Duchi et al. J. of MLR 2011]

### How do I set it up? ###

* Requires: numpy, scipy
* Installation:
```
#!python
cd YourPath
git clone https://github.com/gyglim/gm_submodular.git
cd gm_submodular
python setup.py install --user

```


### Setting started ###
You can find an example [**here**](gm_submodular_usage.ipynb).
This shows how to do submodular maximization as well as learning mixtures of objectives from training data.
